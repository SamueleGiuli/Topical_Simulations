In the following there are the codes I used.
The structure is intuitive from the name of the folders to find the code for a certain task.
Each folder contains 4 files:
- A file something.f90 with the code for the VMC or DMC simulation
- A file something_read.f90 with the code to read the data produced by the code above
- A file .sh to loop along the values of parameters where values can be passed
- A Makefile that produce the executable needed for the .sh file

The steps in each folder to try a simulation are the following:

1) once the specific folder is identified use the command "make" to create the executables.
2) open the .sh file and set the parameters you want to use for the simulation
3) run the .sh file and obtain in output the datas in the file graph.dat

Each code contains some brief comments to explain what are the steps
